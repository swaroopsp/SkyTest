In the whole project i have used

1. lombok 
2. java 8
3. Spring boot
4. Mockito

The source still has some bugs i am aware of. But the design i made is extensible and testable and follows OO.
I have done some basic testing with the spring test and mockito. There is still a scope for more unit testing 
the private methods using power mock. I have followed TDD.
